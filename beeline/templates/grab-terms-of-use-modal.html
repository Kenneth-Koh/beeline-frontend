            <p>
              This Agreement as constituted by the Terms of Use as modified from time to time may not be assigned by you without the prior written approval of the Company but may be assigned without your consent by the Company. Any purported assignment by you in violation of this section shall be void.
            </p>
            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
              This Agreement shall be governed by Singapore law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction, and any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Use or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore to which you hereby agree to submit to.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event that the law in an Alternate Country does not allow jurisdiction to be that of the courts of Singapore or where judgment of a Singapore court is unenforceable in the Alternate Country, unresolved disputes shall be referred to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), in accordance with the Rules of the SIAC as modified or amended from time to time (the “Rules”) by a sole arbitrator appointed by the mutual agreement of the parties (the “Arbitrator”). If parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of SIAC in accordance with the Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              The seat and venue of the arbitration shall be Singapore, in the English language and the fees of the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties, provided that the Arbitrator may require that such fees be borne in such other manner as the Arbitrator determines is required in order for this arbitration clause to be enforceable under applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, the Company or any third party provider as a result of the Terms of Use or use of the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any provision of the Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. This shall, without limitation, also apply to the applicable law and jurisdiction as stipulated above.
            </p>
            <p>
              The failure of the Company to enforce any right or provision in the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by the Company in writing. The Terms of Use comprises the entire agreement between you and the Company and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations or discussions, whether written or oral (if any) between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein.
            </p>
            <p>
              You hereby agree that the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement immediately if it finds in its absolute discretion that you are in breach of any of the terms stipulated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement shall not require the Company to compensate, reimburse or cover any cost incurred by you in the course of you acquiring Services from the third party transportation provider under this Agreement.
